# Machine learning in Python Mini Projects
This repository is a collection of mini Python machine learning projects demonstrating various techniques in clustering, regression, and deep learning using pre-trained models.

#### Each notebook is self-contained, well-documented, and focuses on a specific concept in machine learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
1. [Customer Segmentation (Clustering)](https://github.com/Lubula/Machine-learning-in-Python-Mini-Projects/blob/main/01_customer_segmentation_clustering.ipynb)
